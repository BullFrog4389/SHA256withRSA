## Functions

1. Generate RSA keypair. (Public key is `*.pub`, and private key is `*.pem`.)
2. Sign for a message.
3. Verify if a message from the signer is valid.

## Usage

1. This software is designed at 1080p screen size. It will adapt to the system zoom. If you cannot see the text on buttons clearly, the software may not be suitable for your screen.

2. Get the latest release of this software and run `main.exe`.

### For developers

Run `pip install -r requirements` to install the dependent packages.
